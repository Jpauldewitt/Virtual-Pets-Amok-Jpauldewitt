This is a Virtual Pet Shelter for Virtual pets similar to Tamagotchi or DigiPets.

The object of the game is to keep all of the pets stats below 100 and keep all of the pets overal health at a low level.

The stats are increased every turn by a tick method representing the passage of time, and the stats are also updated based on the users selection of what they want to do each turn.
